== Ruby on Rails Tutorial:  

Welcome aboard! It’s great to have you with me on this journey through the world of Ruby on Rails. Ruby on Rails is known throughout the lands as a powerful web framework that helps developers rapidly build modern web applications. In particular, it provides lots of niceties to help you in your quest to develop a full-featured real-world application and be happy doing it. Great developers are happy developers.
If you're wondering who uses Rails, well there's plenty of companies out there. There's Twitter, Hulu, and Urban Dictionary, just to name a few. This tutorial will teach you how to build a very small and simple application in this first tutorial. Within the first couple of tutorials, you'll have some pretty solid foundations of an application.
There’s much more to the Rails world than might appear at first glance, but not overwhelmingly too much. And what a first glance! Oh, you two haven’t met? Well, time for some introductions then!
